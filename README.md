# MayfliesProject
It is simple mayflies simulation for an independent study at Rose-Hulman

There is very little documentation for this project. I am going to assume that whoever next runs this code will have read through all of the code prior to excecution. 
Limited help will be supplied if asked nicely.

This is a bit of code to simulate how mayflies will act when they are used in a cloud setting.
Here is a blog post explaining everything. http://robhirschfeld.com/2014/03/17/mayflies/
